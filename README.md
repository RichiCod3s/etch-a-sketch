Grid Drawing Application

This is a simple grid-based drawing application where users can dynamically resize the grid and interact with it by hovering over the squares to change their colors.

Features:

-Dynamic Grid Resizing: Users can resize the grid by entering the number of squares per side (up to a maximum of 100).

-Color Change on Hover: Each grid square changes to a random color when the mouse hovers over it.

-Responsive Design: The grid adjusts automatically to fit within the container while maintaining square proportions for each grid item.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For the basic structure of the application.
CSS: For styling the grid, buttons, and hover effects.
JavaScript: For creating and managing the grid dynamically, handling user input, and applying hover effects
